        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am Valeria Munoz, a graduate from Monrovia High School and a current student University of California, Riverside. I am a business undergraduate student, with the plan of entering UCRâ€™s School of Bussiness in the fall of 2021. I am looking forward to declaring my concentration in Marketing, and double-majoring in Political Science as well. Upon graduation, I also look forward to attending the Fashion Institue of Design and Merchandising (FIDM), where I would further my interests in the fashion industry along with developing my skills hands-on along with my knowledge in Design and the business aspect of it. 
 <br><br>

        Besides being a full-time student, I am a part of the Associated Students of UC Riverside (ASUCR) Elections Committee, where we take on the demanding responsibility of putting on election sites, polling, voting advertisement, and anything having to do with elections for UCRâ€™s Student Government in the spring. In that, I am the sub-head of partnerships and incentives, as it is my job to go out and look for potential partnerships with products or vendors that would ultimately attract the students to partake in their civic duty as students to vote.I am also a part of 909 Hip Hop Dance Troupe, a competitive dance team that takes pride in opening up its doors to all levels of dancers, beginners and experienced, in the community and county of Riverside, California. Along with dance, I am passionate about acting. The Louis K. Taylor Performing Arts Center is the company that has allowed me to act on their stage as well as volunteering with building our sets and putting our costumes together. I have been acting since the age of 5 and will continue to do so as long I am given the chance to. Theatre has inspired me to attain a career in Bussiness so that I may pursue the entertainment industry through it, an industry that has held and continues to hold my heart dearly. 
When I am not studying or rehearsing for a performance, I enjoy spending most of my free time painting, reading some of my favorite books, watching documentaries, or playing volleyball (as I also played volleyball for 6 years). 


<br><br>

        
I am a strong believer in individuality and in a well-rounded education. I am incredibly grateful to be attending such a prestigious university that offers a great deal of variety in the courses it offers and one that values the potential and well-being of every student. I think three adjectives that describe me best as a human being would be kind-hearted, truthful, and devoted. In the workplace, however, three adjectives that would suit me best would be committed, creative, and enthusiastic. Though I may not always hold all the knowledge in an area, I have no doubt of my capability of learning, and will always strive to perfect whatever it is that is being taught to me. As I am a good learner, I am also great at teaching. I believe that teaching in a loving and patient environment is a great contributor to success in the workplace; not just for one-self or the employee as an individual, but as the company overall. With my business education, my trilingual abilities as I am fluent in Spanish and French, my individual and teamwork ethic, and my desire to learn, I am confident in being a qualified candidate for the upcoming job and the challenges it may bring.
